## 1. Why deploy on the internet, isnâ€™t localhost enough?

What's wrong in the following message? Is jimmy lying?

## 2. Domains vs IPs

### LocalHost

- "Localhost" refers to the computer you're currently working on. 

- It's essentially a loopback address that points to the machine itself, allowing it to communicate with itself over a network. 

- In technical terms, the IP address for localhost is usually `127.0.0.1` for IPv4, or `::1` for IPv6.

### ping command

- Try running

```solidity
ping localhost
```

- Now try pinging google

```solidity
ping google.com
```

Notice google points to a different `IP address` .

### IP (Internet Protocol) Address:

- An **IP address** is a unique string of numbers that identifies a device on a network, like the internet. Think of it like a **house address**: it's how computers (or any devices on the network) know where to send information.

- For example, `192.168.1.1` is an IP address.

- An **IP address** is essential for routing data on the internet, but it's not the most human-friendly system.

- Range of IPV4 addresses are from 0 to 255. For example `0-255.0-255.0-255.0-255`. Thus the total number of IP's are limited.

### Domain name

- A **domain name** is the readable, human-friendly address we use to access websites, like `google.com` or `example.org`.

- Domains are a higher-level abstraction that makes it easier for us to remember websites instead of trying to recall a string of numbers (like an IP address).

- For instance, when you type `www.google.com` into your browser, your computer looks up that domain name and finds the corresponding IP address, then connects to the website.

### Domain name vs Phone number

### Limited IP addresses

- There are limited number of IP addresses in the world (ipv4 specially). 

- So itâ€™s not very easy for us to get a public IP. 

- Most IPs are blocked by cloud providers or Big companies (JIO)

## 3. Local network, routing (mild hosting)

- If you have multiple laptops on the same `wifi router`, you can access one machine from another by using their private IP address. 

- The reason why it is called as private IP is because it's not exposed on the internet yet.

- This is a `mild` version of deploying your app on your `local network` (or whats called the intranet)

<img src="./assets/Pic-4.png" />

### Steps to follow

1. Start a node.js process locally on port 3000

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

2. Find the IP of your machine on the local network

```bash
ifconfig or ipconfig
```

This commands shows all the network interfaces i.e various ways to reach your machine.

**Note :** If I go to `192.168.1.3:3000` on my phone, I should be able to visit the website

### Hosts file

You can override what your domain name resolves to by overriding the hosts file.

```bash
# Mini DNS server
vi /etc/hosts
127.0.0.01	harkirat.100xdevs.com
```
<img src="./assets/Pic-7.png" />

**NOTE** : Can you think of how you can phis your friend into giving their credentials by using this approach?

## 4. How to deploy apps (actual hosting)?

1. Renting servers on a cloud.
2. Renting compute yourself in data centers.
3. Self hosting (buying a CPU rack in your house).
4. Serverless providers.
5. Cloud native options (k8s).

## 5. What is a VM

<img src="./assets/Pic-8.png" />

- VMs run on a physical server (called the **host**) but are abstracted through a layer of virtualization software called a **hypervisor** (e.g., VMware, KVM). 

- This hypervisor divides the host machineâ€™s resources (CPU, memory, storage) into separate virtual machines.

- Each VM acts like a completely independent machine, even though they share the underlying hardware. 

- You can run different operating systems and applications in different VMs on the same physical server.

- VMs are highly flexible and easy to scale. You can quickly spin up, modify, or delete VMs, and you can consolidate multiple workloads on a single server.

- The virtualization layer introduces a slight overhead in terms of performance because the hypervisor needs to manage resources and ensure each VM operates independently. 

- However, with modern hypervisors and powerful hardware, this overhead is minimal.

<img src="./assets/Pic-9.png" />

## 6. Bare metal servers

- In a bare-metal setup, an operating system (OS) runs directly on the physical hardware without a hypervisor in between. Thereâ€™s no virtualization layer.

- Since there's no hypervisor, bare-metal systems tend to offer better performance, as the OS can directly access all the serverâ€™s resources without sharing them with other instances. 

- This is especially important for high-performance applications like large databases, gaming servers, or mining crypto

- With bare-metal, youâ€™re typically limited to the resources (CPU, memory, storage) of the actual physical server. You can't dynamically allocate resources like you can in a VM.

## 7. SSH protocol, password based auth

- The **SSH protocol** (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol that allows secure communication between two systems, typically for remote administration. 

- Itâ€™s most commonly used to log into remote servers and execute commands, but it also facilitates secure file transfers and other operations.

- The default ssh port is 22. 

### Key Features of SSH:

1. **Encryption**: SSH encrypts the data thatâ€™s sent between the client and the server, so even if someone intercepts the connection, they canâ€™t read the data. This makes it much more secure than older protocols like Telnet or FTP, which transmit data in plaintext.

2. **Authentication**: SSH can use two methods of authentication:
    - **Password-based**: You enter a password to authenticate yourself to the remote system.
    - **Public Key-based**: A more secure method, where the client uses a private key to authenticate, and the server checks it against the corresponding public key. This eliminates the need for passwords and provides an extra layer of security.

3. **Integrity**: SSH ensures the integrity of data, meaning that data cannot be tampered with while itâ€™s in transit. If someone tries to alter the data being sent, the connection will be immediately disrupted.

### Password based

While setting up a server, select password based authentication

**Example from `digitalocean`**

<img src="./assets/Pic-11.png" />

<img src="./assets/Pic-12.png" />

```bash
ssh ubuntu@SERVER_IP
or
ssh root@SERVER_IP
```

**NOTE** : `root` is the user that you are logging in as.

## 8. SSH protocol, ssh keypair based

- It's basically identifying yourself to a machine.

    <img src="./assets/Pic-13.png" />

    **NOTE** : This can happen vice-versa.

- It's basically telling the server that I have a private key, here is my public key. So whenever I try to ssh into the server using the private key, that public key in the sever verfies my identity.

    <img src="./assets/Pic-14.png" />

    **NOTE** : The extension of public key file is `.pub`. It stays in `/Users/amithbv/.ssh`. Private key file has no extension.

    For example, private key is `id_rsa`, public key is `id_rsa.pub`.

- Generate a new public private keypair : 

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen
    OR
    /User/harkiratsingh/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```
â€‹
- Explore your public and private key : 

    ```bash
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```

- Once you create a VM and ssh into it using public-private key, your public key will be stored in `.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

- Try adding it to digitalocean and ssh using it.

    <img src="./assets/Pic-15.png" />

    ```bash
    ssh ubuntu@IP
    or
    git clone git@github.com:100xdevs-cohort-3/week-24-deposit-with-infra.git (try a private repo)
    ```

    <img src="./assets/Pic-16.png" />

- Check authorized_keys

    ```bash
    cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

        Put your public key in your friends laptop as an authorized key.

## Algorithms for public key cryptography

The `ssh-keygen` tool can generate SSH key pairs using several different cryptographic algorithms, depending on what you choose during the key creation process. By default, it typically uses **RSA**, but you can specify other algorithms as well. Here are the most commonly used algorithms:

### **1. RSA (Rivestâ€“Shamirâ€“Adleman)**

- **Default Algorithm** (for most systems): The `ssh-keygen` tool uses RSA by default when creating keys.
- RSA is a widely-used public-key algorithm that provides strong security.

### **2. Ed25519**

- **A newer and more secure option**: Ed25519 is a modern elliptic curve algorithm that is designed to provide both high security and efficiency.
- Itâ€™s **faster**, more **secure** for the same key size, and less prone to certain vulnerabilities compared to RSA.

```solidity
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

### **3. ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)**

- **Another elliptic curve algorithm**, which is considered a more secure and efficient alternative to RSA for most use cases.

## 9. IP address of your machine

If you get a VM on digitalocean, there is an associated IP address to it. This is a public IP address that you can use to reach the server anywhere around the world.
